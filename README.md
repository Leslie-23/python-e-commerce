---

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/E-com/Leslie-23/e-commerce-Platform-master.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

   ```bash
   cd e-commerce-Platform-master
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create the Environment Config File**

   Inside the `dbInitialData` folder, create a file named `.env` and fill it like this (update with your own MySQL credentials):

   ```dotenv
   HOST=localhost
   USER=root
   PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   DATABASE=ecomdb
   ```

5. **Run the App**

   Start the application using:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   * If the database doesn’t exist yet, it will be created and filled with sample data.
   * If the database already exists, the app will just start without changing any data.
